## PLAGIARISM

- You can repurpose / edit learn platform code, stack overflow, or lecture code to make it work for you, HOWEVER if you copy paste LARGE amounts of code without any changes, that is considered plagiarism. Students have been EXPELLED for plagiarism.
- Other examples: cloning entire online repos of a past students exam, sharing exam code with other students, etc. We have had to expel students for these violations as well.

## Questions

- Can ask for clarification (what something is, but not how to do it)
